    title: "The Peacock Principle: Why Sexual Selection Could Hold the Key to True AI Intelligence",
    date: 'April 10, 2025',
    content: [
      "Our quest for artificial intelligence has become a high-stakes standardized test—and we might be studying for the wrong exam.",
      "Consider this: The highest-scoring students rarely become history's great innovators. Einstein was an unremarkable student. Darwin nearly failed divinity school. Jobs dropped out entirely. The valedictorian often gets outpaced by classmates who were merely \"smart enough\" but possessed qualities no standardized test could capture: adaptability, creative insight, social intuition, resilience. Yet our AI development strategy remains fixated on benchmark domination, producing systems that excel at predefined tasks while fundamentally lacking the adaptive brilliance that defines transformative intelligence.",
      "Our latest AI marvels approach or surpass human-level performance across standard domains, prompting an uncomfortable question: <b>What happens when AI aces humanity's last exam?</b> The answer is becoming increasingly clear. True superintelligence—the kind that generates revolutionary breakthroughs or paradigm-shifting insights—remains frustratingly beyond reach. Our benchmark-optimized approach produces increasingly powerful narrow specialists, not the conceptual revolutionaries we need.",
      "We're building faster horses when what we need is the automobile—something fundamentally different and more powerful than incremental improvements to existing frameworks.",
      "Nature, however, offers us an elegant solution hidden in plain sight: sexual selection.",
      "Natural selection optimizes for survival. Sexual selection optimizes for something profoundly different—attractive signals that honestly advertise fitness across multiple dimensions simultaneously. This creates seemingly wasteful features like the peacock's magnificent tail. That elaborate tail doesn't help survival. It exists purely as a signal. What makes this signal reliable is the differential cost - it's significantly more expensive for weak peacocks to produce than for strong ones.",
      "Human intelligence itself likely evolved partly as a mating display. Our capacity for art, music, humor, and complex language serves as costly signals of our genetic quality. When people spend hours crafting the perfect tweet or TikTok performance, they're engaging in modern forms of the same costly signaling that drove our evolution.",
      "This suggests a potentially revolutionary framework for AI development: Instead of rewarding systems solely for benchmark performance, we could mimic sexual selection's multidimensional balancing act.",
      "Imagine AI systems that must demonstrate competence across multiple competing dimensions simultaneously: solving problems correctly while also being computationally efficient, adaptable to distribution shifts, and resilient to adversarial inputs. In this framework, excelling in just one dimension (like test accuracy) would become an unreliable signal of general capability—just as a peacock with a spectacular tail but weakened immune system fails nature's test.",
      "This approach suggests a promising framework for AI development—what we might call \"The Peacock Principle\": a multi-objective evolutionary approach that would subject neural networks to pressures beyond mere task performance:",
      "1. <b>Performance:</b> Can it solve complex tasks at human-competitive levels?",
      "2. <b>Efficiency:</b> Can it do so with minimal computational resources?",
      "3. <b>Adaptability:</b> Can it transfer knowledge across domains without catastrophic forgetting?",
      "4. <b>Robustness:</b> Can it handle novel inputs far outside its training distribution?",
      "5. <b>Adversarial Resistance:</b> Can it maintain performance under targeted attacks?",
      "While this remains a theoretical proposal rather than an implemented system, the potential implications are profound. By evolving AI systems under these combined pressures, we might observe the emergence of capabilities not explicitly trained for—perhaps even modular architectures that could dynamically reconfigure for new tasks, similar to biological neural systems.",
      "A concrete example of how this approach might work: Imagine evolving small LoRA adapters (parameter-efficient fine-tuning modules) for foundational language models on a diverse mixture of reasoning, creative, and factual tasks. Conventional fine-tuning often produces adapters that perform impressively on training distributions but collapse on slightly modified problems. An evolutionary approach could potentially optimize for both in-distribution performance and generalization capability simultaneously, leading to more robust systems.",
      "Hypothetically, such a system might sacrifice a few percentage points on benchmark leaderboards while dramatically outperforming conventional approaches when faced with distribution shifts or novel scenarios—much like how natural intelligence prioritizes adaptability over narrow specialization.",
      "One particularly intriguing possibility is that an evolutionary approach might discover novel architectural patterns that human engineers wouldn't typically consider. For instance, crossover between different model components might create hybrid architectures that preserve complementary capabilities from each \"parent\" model, potentially leading to structures that resemble biological neural organization patterns.",
      "This approach wouldn't be without substantial challenges. Defining appropriate \"costly signals\" for AI would require interdisciplinary expertise in both machine learning and evolutionary biology. The computational demands of evolutionary search would exceed standard training by orders of magnitude. And there's always the risk that we simply shift optimization to a different set of metrics without solving the fundamental problem.",
      "But the potential rewards are immense. When we examine the history of revolutionary technologies, they rarely emerge from linear improvements to existing paradigms. The Wright brothers weren't the engineers with the biggest engines but the ones who reconceptualized the problem. Einstein's breakthrough wasn't calculating physics problems faster but reimagining space and time entirely.",
      "Perhaps AGI won't emerge from engineering against predefined benchmarks. Maybe, like the peacock's tail, human creativity, or biological intelligence itself, it will emerge from evolutionary processes that reward honest, costly signals of general competence—signals that by their nature cannot be easily gamed or faked.",
      "The most capable AI systems might turn out to be not the ones that score highest on our existing tests, but those that demonstrate balanced excellence across multiple competing objectives—just as in nature, the most successful organisms aren't specialized for a single environment but adaptable across many.",
      "The path to true AI intelligence may require us to stop teaching to the test and start evolving for the real world."

    date: 'March 31, 2025',
    content: [
      "\"What if?\" my wife whispered on our balcony, the sounds of our sleeping children drifting through the open window. \"What if we're really having a third?\"",
      "Last night, in this twilight confession, we acknowledged the possibility we've been carefully holding: we might be expecting our third child. It's early days—too early for grand announcements—but just right for quiet conversations about what might lie ahead.",
      "In these preliminary moments, my mind wanders to the practical realities. If this early hope becomes our next chapter, our cozy home that perfectly fits our family of four will need to change.",
      "<b>The Mathematics of Space and Heart</b>\n\nI've been thinking about something Naval Ravikant said—about how children offer \"an automatic built-in meaning to life.\" I've experienced this firsthand watching Kai and Zoe grow. Each milestone, from Zoe's careful animal-name writing to Kai's breakthroughs sounding out difficult words, creates a sense of purpose that nothing else in my life has matched.",
      "Naval describes a natural progression in what we care for—we start by taking care of ourselves, then extend to our immediate family, then further outward. This expansion requires sacrifice and adjustment. But within these challenges lies something profound that I've felt most deeply in those quiet moments of connection with my children.",
      "As I consider our family potentially growing, I'm struck by how these sacrifices—leaving our convenient location, moving away from our walkable town center and neighborhood—feel less like losses and more like exchanges for a richer kind of joy. We'll need a larger home, not a smaller one, but it will likely be further from the community we've come to love.",
      "<b>What We'll Leave Behind</b>\n\nOur current home is more than just four walls. It's our sanctuary in a walkable neighborhood where we've built community, with morning routines of counting boats on the horizon during our shoreline walks. It's where my work life and family life have blended, allowing me to be present for countless small moments with our children.",
      "The thought of leaving it brings a pang of genuine loss.",
      "<b>What Matters Most</b>\n\nYet being a father has transformed what I consider valuable. Not a day passes without my children bringing unexpected joy—like when Kai cuddles with Pepe our pug, or when Zoe beams with pride after writing animal names. They are, without question, our greatest joy.",
      "There are moments that transcend the everyday routine of parenting—like last night, when Kai's eyes lit up as he sounded out a difficult word, that flash of pride mirroring my own expression. Or catching my daughter unconsciously tucking her hair behind her ear exactly the way my wife does. These small reflections feel almost metaphysical. We created these people. They are extensions of us, yet entirely their own beings.",
      "I feel fortunate to appreciate these early years, knowing how quickly they pass.",
      "<b>Building My Legacy</b>\n\nIn a world that increasingly celebrates individual achievement, I find myself swimming against the current. Without a large extended family growing up, I've always felt the absence of those deeper connections. Now, I have the chance to create what I missed—to build something that will outlast any career achievement.",
      "I want to grow old surrounded by people I love. I want holiday tables filled with conversation and laughter. I want to see my children supporting each other long after my wife and I are gone. This is my version of immortality—people who carry our values forward into a future I won't fully witness.",
      "When viewed through this lens, the decision to expand our family isn't just about adding another person—it's about investing in the most meaningful legacy I could create.",
      "I recognize that many thoughtful people make different choices. There's no universal formula for a meaningful life. But for me, the path feels increasingly clear.",
      "<b>The Real Challenges Ahead</b>\n\nI'm not naïve about what adding a third child means. We're talking about being outnumbered. About years of interrupted sleep again. About more complex logistics for everything from bedtime routines to holiday travel.",
      "There will be days when I'll question this decision. When three different needs collide simultaneously and my wife and I exchange that look that says, \"What were we thinking?\"",
      "But having navigated the early years with Kai and Zoe, I've learned that difficult phases are temporary, but relationships are permanent. The sleep deprivation ends. What remains is the family we've built—the connections that become increasingly valuable as life goes on.",
      "<b>Lessons from Previous Leaps</b>\n\nThis isn't our first time sacrificing comfort for growth. When we moved to New York years ago, we traded familiar routines for a studio apartment with rats in the elevator, during the coldest winter in 100 years. As weeks of bitter cold and city grime wore on us, we often questioned if we'd made a terrible mistake.",
      "That move taught me something vital: initial discomfort fades as new routines take hold. What appeared as sacrifice became opportunity. The career connections I made there directly led to my current work arrangement—the one that allows me to be present for my children.",
      "Last Sunday, watching our two children playing in the bath together, I felt a profound certainty about adding a third voice to their collaborative chaos. They're already building a beautiful little civilization with room to grow.",
      "<b>Looking Forward: Thick Desires in a World of Thin Wants</b>\n\nLuke Burgis writes about \"thick\" and \"thin\" desires—the thick ones genuinely fulfill us, while thin desires are the superficial wants society often convinces us to prioritize.",
      "A house with beautiful views, a walkable neighborhood, proximity to the coffee shop—these are \"thin desires.\" They enhance our lives but are replaceable comforts. Sometimes these thin desires serve the thicker ones—our walkable neighborhood has facilitated the connections that strengthen our family bonds.",
      "Our thick desires run deeper: building a family that will nurture each other, creating enduring sibling bonds, and welcoming another soul who will carry our values forward. When framed this way, the decision becomes remarkably clear.",
      "My wife reminds me that homes are made, not found. A house is just the backdrop for the family that fills it.",
      "The truth is simple: what we're choosing isn't between a beachfront view and more bedrooms. It's between clinging to what we have and embracing what we might become. Between the family we are and the family we hope to be.",
      "When I imagine myself decades from now, I know which choice I'll be grateful for. The memories we make together will long outlast any address."

    title: 'It\'s Tokens All The Way Down',
    date: 'March 28, 2025',
    content: [
      "\"The future belongs to those who consume the most tokens.\"\nThis line, casually dropped by a friend, has been rattling around in my head for weeks. It's not just a clever play on Silicon Valley jargon—it's the most concise expression I've found of the economic transformation happening around us. He wasn't talking about cryptocurrencies, but computational inference—the resources required to run AI models at scale.",
      "I've been trying to keep up with the pace of AI change. It's moving faster than crypto and is truly exponential. This creates a fundamental blindspot in how we plan and build. Most of us are still thinking in terms of steady progress when we're actually facing hockey stick curves.",
      "We're at a moment similar to the early electrification of industry. In 1900, most factories still used a central steam engine with complex systems of shafts and belts to power individual machines. The visionaries weren't those who built bigger steam engines but those who recognized that distributed electric motors would change everything.",
      "The token economy works similarly. Big companies are building massive, centralized AI models—the equivalent of those giant steam engines. But the real transformation is happening at the endpoints, where specialized applications precisely apply AI to specific problems.",
      "I've watched the constraints shift over the years. First it was capital. Then technical talent. Now we're witnessing another transformation: computational leverage. The builders who win aren't merely those who write code, but those who masterfully orchestrate AI to write it for them.",
      "This inverts traditional competitive dynamics. Good ideas were always abundant, but implementation was hard. Now implementation is increasingly commoditized. The constraint has moved upstream to problem selection and domain insight.",
      "When everyone has access to the same AI tools, differentiation comes from somewhere else. I'm convinced the real value lies in model wrappers – specialized interfaces like Cursor for coding that create value by adapting general-purpose AI to specific verticals. What's remarkable is how this enables small teams to bootstrap highly specific products that would have required venture funding before. You can now build for narrower markets, keep larger equity percentages, and still create substantial value.",
      "The edge isn't just in prompt engineering. It's in being bilingual – fluent in both human and machine communication, toggling effortlessly between them. The most valuable people I know can translate business requirements into machine instructions and then translate machine outputs back into human insights.",
      "What's counterintuitive is how this shift makes system lock-in simultaneously more valuable and more attainable. The conventional wisdom says AI commoditizes everything, but I'm seeing the opposite. AI actually makes it easier to create sticky systems when your wrapper becomes the preferred interface to powerful models. Users who train on your interface develop muscle memory and dataset dependencies that are surprisingly hard to migrate.",
      "Domain expertise becomes the big lock. When anyone can generate functional code through prompts, your unique insights into specific industries, user needs, and technical niches become the true competitive moat.",
      "For those building products today, the metrics that matter have changed. \"Token economics\" isn't just about cryptocurrency—it's about how efficiently you convert computational resources into customer value.",
      "The real opportunity isn't in raw token consumption, but in token arbitrage—finding those specific applications where small amounts of computation create disproportionate value. The electricity analogy holds: nobody cared about kilowatt-hours per se; they cared about what those kilowatt-hours enabled. The biggest fortunes went not to power companies but to those who found novel applications for electricity.",
      "The projects that win won't be those burning the most tokens, but those creating the most value per token consumed. While big companies optimize for scale, small teams can optimize for specificity. This is the arbitrage opportunity of our time: being precisely useful in narrow domains where AI needs human expertise to be truly effective. In the economy of tokens, the craftsperson beats the factory."

      "This week my feed is flooded with Studio Ghibli images from ChatGPT's 4o update. By the middle of next week, I suspect it will be largely forgotten, replaced by something else equally ephemeral. When I mention it to friends or family outside of my filter bubble, they'll likely have no idea what I'm talking about.",
      "What was the last viral thing you forgot?",
      "Having transitioned from luxury alcohol branding to crypto, I've developed an eye for how ideas spread—or don't. There's a phenomenon accelerating around us I call \"memetic churn\": the increasingly rapid cycle of cultural ideas that rise to ubiquity then disappear almost instantly, creating a kind of cultural amnesia.",
      "Memetic churn operates on a simple principle: every day there is a new Thing, and it's more Thingier than the previous Thing. Traditional memes, as conceived by Dawkins, emphasized longevity. Internet memes have inverted this—the most successful often burn brightest and die fastest.",
      "The acceleration is striking: The Budweiser \"Wassup\" campaign (1999) remained culturally relevant for years. People still quote it occasionally, 25 years later. By 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated for weeks. In early 2025, Saratoga water bottles featured in an influencer's morning routine saturated my feed on Tuesday and were completely gone by Wednesday. Now it's Studio Ghibli images generated by AI.",
      "As someone who is addicted to X to stay up to date with crypto, I've become an unwitting observer of this acceleration more acutely than those who maintain a healthier relationship with social media. The algorithms are optimized not just for engagement but for novelty, constantly pushing fresh content that makes yesterday's viral sensation feel like ancient history.",
      "What we're experiencing is \"digital-induced amnesia\"—a collective forgetting caused by overconsumption of digital stimuli. Our brains simply weren't designed to process information at this speed.",
      "Shared narratives matter for EVERYTHING. We are a species that lives off shared narrative. As Yuval Noah Harari argues in Sapiens, our unique ability to believe collectively in abstract concepts—from money to nations to brands—is what enabled humanity to cooperate at scale. When memes flash by too quickly to establish common ground, we lose more than entertainment; we lose the cultural scaffolding that makes human coordination possible.",
      "As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, we're approaching a reality where much of what we read online was never seen by another human. It's bespoke content, algorithmically tailored just for us, ensuring our experiences become increasingly personalized and simultaneously less shared.",
      "Does this matter? I think it does. In both crypto and luxury marketing, I've witnessed firsthand how sustained narratives build communities and brands. Yet perhaps the beauty of Studio Ghibli AI images lies precisely in their fleeting nature—a shared moment rather than a lasting monument.",
      "Perhaps the real cost of our accelerating memetic churn isn't cultural amnesia, but cultural atomization. When nothing persists long enough to become truly shared knowledge, we lose not just content but context—the foundation upon which communities build meaning. In a world optimized for novelty, remembering might be the most radical act of all."

      "Had dinner with a friend who's CFO at a large CPG company. Told him about \"vibe coding\" - using AI tools like Cursor to build products with minimal coding experience. He got it immediately.",
      "While his company pays McKinsey millions, he instantly saw how targeted software could be developed for a fraction of the cost this way. No surprise there. He's sharp.",
      "The interesting part isn't just that these tools let non-programmers code. It's what that enables economically.",
      "For decades, software startups followed a predictable path: raise VC money to hire engineers, give up equity, chase billion-dollar outcomes. The minimum viable startup was expensive.",
      "Now small teams can build useful software without being expert programmers. A bootstrapped team can create a targeted solution, charge reasonably, and build a profitable business without pitching VCs.",
      "Instead of every startup trying to be a unicorn, we'll see thousands of small, profitable businesses addressing narrow but real needs. Founders can retain equity and build sustainable businesses on their own terms.",
      "For large companies, it means bypassing IT bottlenecks. My CFO friend immediately started thinking about what leaving his job and starting a business like this could be like. He even considered poaching their IT guy to join him.",

      "I signed up for Cursor yesterday. It's impressive how easy it is to deploy code with AI tools now. A decade ago, the limiting factor in building software was often writing the code itself. Now it's something else entirely.",
      "What's interesting about tools like Cursor is that they solve problems we've always had while simultaneously creating new ones. The deployment friction is gone. But debugging can become oddly circular. The AI sometimes removes code you actually wanted to keep or fails to identify the true source of a problem.",
      "This creates a strange paradox. You save time on the creative aspects of coding but can lose it in these new debugging dead ends. I've found myself feeling lethargic about working on my basic blog project. The initial enthusiasm has worn off, replaced by a low-grade frustration with these circular debugging sessions.",
      "The solution isn't abandoning AI tools. Rather, it's getting better at using them. Prompting is becoming a genuine skill—one that most programmers didn't need until recently. Learning to communicate precisely with these systems is surprisingly nuanced. It's not unlike learning to work with a new junior developer who's brilliant in some ways but has peculiar blind spots.",
      "What I need now isn't to abandon the blog but to supplement it with something fresh—another project to reignite my enthusiasm for the week. And ironically, I'll be using AI tools for that too. Because despite the frustrations, they're still incredibly powerful for rapid prototyping and exploration.",
      "The rhythm of software development is changing. The cycles of excitement and lethargy happen faster. The tools accelerate everything—both the progress and the problems. The key is learning to ride these waves rather than being overwhelmed by them.",
