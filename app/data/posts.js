    title: 'The AI Tool Paradox',
    date: 'March 26, 2025',
    content: [
      "I signed up for Cursor yesterday. It's impressive how easy it is to deploy code with AI tools now. A decade ago, the limiting factor in building software was often writing the code itself. Now it's something else entirely.",
      "What's interesting about tools like Cursor is that they solve problems we've always had while simultaneously creating new ones. The deployment friction is gone. But debugging can become oddly circular. The AI sometimes removes code you actually wanted to keep or fails to identify the true source of a problem.",
      "This creates a strange paradox. You save time on the creative aspects of coding but can lose it in these new debugging dead ends. I've found myself feeling lethargic about working on my basic blog project. The initial enthusiasm has worn off, replaced by a low-grade frustration with these circular debugging sessions.",
      "The solution isn't abandoning AI tools. Rather, it's getting better at using them. Prompting is becoming a genuine skill—one that most programmers didn't need until recently. Learning to communicate precisely with these systems is surprisingly nuanced. It's not unlike learning to work with a new junior developer who's brilliant in some ways but has peculiar blind spots.",
      "What I need now isn't to abandon the blog but to supplement it with something fresh—another project to reignite my enthusiasm for the week. And ironically, I'll be using AI tools for that too. Because despite the frustrations, they're still incredibly powerful for rapid prototyping and exploration.",
      "The rhythm of software development is changing. The cycles of excitement and lethargy happen faster. The tools accelerate everything—both the progress and the problems. The key is learning to ride these waves rather than being overwhelmed by them.",
      "I suspect the best developers of the coming years won't necessarily be those who memorize the most algorithms or language features, but those who become fluent in this new kind of collaboration."

      "I stumbled across a \"chaos coding\" class today during lunch. Not just any class—one taught by my good friend Aaron Wright, who I recently spent time with at ETH Denver.",
      "Aaron is probably within the top 1% of Cursor users globally. When someone at that level offers to share their knowledge, you show up. Despite being a lawyer by trade, he's absolutely obsessed with the platform. When he announced he was running a showcase class, I had to join.",
      "Within 45 minutes, we had collectively vibe coded an entire 3D world on Cursor.",
      "Five months ago, I first tried Cursor as a complete non-coder. I managed to create a rudimentary snake game, but the process was painful—hours of debugging for minimal progress.",
      "But something fundamental has changed. The debugging process still exists, but what previously took hours now happens in minutes. The system has gotten significantly more intelligent, more responsive.",
      "This is how technology actually progresses. Not in smooth curves economists draw on graphs, but in sudden, jarring leaps that reconfigure what's possible. One day something is difficult; the next, it's trivially easy.",
      "Vibe coding isn't just another programming trend. It's a fundamental rethinking of who can create software and how quickly ideas can materialize.",
      "The best software tools don't just make existing programmers more efficient—they expand who can program in the first place.",
      "The barriers between imagination and implementation are collapsing.",
      "The time is now."

      "After leading insights and analytics at Diageo and spending over a decade in crypto, I've noticed striking parallels between consumer behavior models and crypto market cycles.",
      "The boom-bust cycles of crypto markets follow patterns remarkably similar to traditional consumer adoption curves, just accelerated. Early adopters, the mainstream wave, and laggards all behave according to well-established principles of behavioral economics. What's different is the compressed timeframe and amplified reactions within the crypto space.",
      "Consider the classic Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation curve. In traditional markets, this adoption process might take years or decades. In crypto, we see the same pattern compressed into months or a few years at most."

      "Having founded multiple Investment DAOs including Flamingo, Neon, Ready Player, and Zero, I've witnessed the evolution of governance models firsthand.",
      "When we launched Flamingo in 2019, the DAO landscape was still in its infancy. Our governance model was idealistic - one token, one vote, with all major decisions requiring community approval."
