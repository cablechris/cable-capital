    title: "The Peacock Principle: Why Sexual Selection Could Hold the Key to True AI Intelligence",
    date: 'April 10, 2025',
    content: [
      "Our quest for artificial intelligence has become a high-stakes standardized test—and we might be studying for the wrong exam.",
      "Consider this: The highest-scoring students rarely become history's great innovators. Einstein was an unremarkable student. Darwin nearly failed divinity school. Jobs dropped out entirely. The valedictorian often gets outpaced by classmates who were merely \"smart enough\" but possessed qualities no standardized test could capture: adaptability, creative insight, social intuition, resilience. Yet our AI development strategy remains fixated on benchmark domination, producing systems that excel at predefined tasks while fundamentally lacking the adaptive brilliance that defines transformative intelligence.",
      "Our latest AI marvels approach or surpass human-level performance across standard domains, prompting an uncomfortable question: <b>What happens when AI aces humanity's last exam?</b> The answer is becoming increasingly clear. True superintelligence—the kind that generates revolutionary breakthroughs or paradigm-shifting insights—remains frustratingly beyond reach. Our benchmark-optimized approach produces increasingly powerful narrow specialists, not the conceptual revolutionaries we need.",
      "We're building faster horses when what we need is the automobile—something fundamentally different and more powerful than incremental improvements to existing frameworks.",
      "Nature, however, offers us an elegant solution hidden in plain sight: sexual selection.",
      "Natural selection optimizes for survival. Sexual selection optimizes for something profoundly different—attractive signals that honestly advertise fitness across multiple dimensions simultaneously. This creates seemingly wasteful features like the peacock's magnificent tail. That elaborate tail doesn't help survival. It exists purely as a signal. What makes this signal reliable is the differential cost - it's significantly more expensive for weak peacocks to produce than for strong ones.",
      "Human intelligence itself likely evolved partly as a mating display. Our capacity for art, music, humor, and complex language serves as costly signals of our genetic quality. When people spend hours crafting the perfect tweet or TikTok performance, they're engaging in modern forms of the same costly signaling that drove our evolution.",
      "This suggests a potentially revolutionary framework for AI development: Instead of rewarding systems solely for benchmark performance, we could mimic sexual selection's multidimensional balancing act.",
      "Imagine AI systems that must demonstrate competence across multiple competing dimensions simultaneously: solving problems correctly while also being computationally efficient, adaptable to distribution shifts, and resilient to adversarial inputs. In this framework, excelling in just one dimension (like test accuracy) would become an unreliable signal of general capability—just as a peacock with a spectacular tail but weakened immune system fails nature's test.",
      "This approach suggests a promising framework for AI development—what we might call \"The Peacock Principle\": a multi-objective evolutionary approach that would subject neural networks to pressures beyond mere task performance:",
      "1. <b>Performance:</b> Can it solve complex tasks at human-competitive levels?",
      "2. <b>Efficiency:</b> Can it do so with minimal computational resources?",
      "3. <b>Adaptability:</b> Can it transfer knowledge across domains without catastrophic forgetting?",
      "4. <b>Robustness:</b> Can it handle novel inputs far outside its training distribution?",
      "5. <b>Adversarial Resistance:</b> Can it maintain performance under targeted attacks?",
      "While this remains a theoretical proposal rather than an implemented system, the potential implications are profound. By evolving AI systems under these combined pressures, we might observe the emergence of capabilities not explicitly trained for—perhaps even modular architectures that could dynamically reconfigure for new tasks, similar to biological neural systems.",
      "A concrete example of how this approach might work: Imagine evolving small LoRA adapters (parameter-efficient fine-tuning modules) for foundational language models on a diverse mixture of reasoning, creative, and factual tasks. Conventional fine-tuning often produces adapters that perform impressively on training distributions but collapse on slightly modified problems. An evolutionary approach could potentially optimize for both in-distribution performance and generalization capability simultaneously, leading to more robust systems.",
      "Hypothetically, such a system might sacrifice a few percentage points on benchmark leaderboards while dramatically outperforming conventional approaches when faced with distribution shifts or novel scenarios—much like how natural intelligence prioritizes adaptability over narrow specialization.",
      "One particularly intriguing possibility is that an evolutionary approach might discover novel architectural patterns that human engineers wouldn't typically consider. For instance, crossover between different model components might create hybrid architectures that preserve complementary capabilities from each \"parent\" model, potentially leading to structures that resemble biological neural organization patterns.",
      "This approach wouldn't be without substantial challenges. Defining appropriate \"costly signals\" for AI would require interdisciplinary expertise in both machine learning and evolutionary biology. The computational demands of evolutionary search would exceed standard training by orders of magnitude. And there's always the risk that we simply shift optimization to a different set of metrics without solving the fundamental problem.",
      "But the potential rewards are immense. When we examine the history of revolutionary technologies, they rarely emerge from linear improvements to existing paradigms. The Wright brothers weren't the engineers with the biggest engines but the ones who reconceptualized the problem. Einstein's breakthrough wasn't calculating physics problems faster but reimagining space and time entirely.",
      "Perhaps AGI won't emerge from engineering against predefined benchmarks. Maybe, like the peacock's tail, human creativity, or biological intelligence itself, it will emerge from evolutionary processes that reward honest, costly signals of general competence—signals that by their nature cannot be easily gamed or faked.",
      "The most capable AI systems might turn out to be not the ones that score highest on our existing tests, but those that demonstrate balanced excellence across multiple competing objectives—just as in nature, the most successful organisms aren't specialized for a single environment but adaptable across many.",
      "The path to true AI intelligence may require us to stop teaching to the test and start evolving for the real world."

      "Most advice about investing follows a standard template: diversify, dollar-cost average, gradually reduce risk as you age. This advice isn't wrong, but it misses something important.",
      "What it misses is that your relationship with risk is something you can train, like a muscle.",
      "In 2016, I had what I can only describe as a 'lightning strike moment' when I realized crypto was going to become a whole new asset class. It was visceral, almost religious in its clarity. For a while after that, I had nearly 99% of my net worth in crypto.",
      "That sounds insane to most financial advisors. And it would be insane for most people. But there's a specific case where it might not be: when you're young, have a reliable income, and no dependents.",
      "This isn't an essay about crypto specifically. It's about the value of experiencing volatility firsthand, early in your investing life.",
      "Now I have two young kids and a different risk profile. I'm still incredibly exposed to crypto by any standard, but I've diversified. Here's something interesting: market drops of 10-15% in stocks don't phase me at all. After experiencing multiple +80% drawdowns in crypto, traditional market movements feel trivial.",
      "That's a psychological edge most investors don't have.",
      "Most people's first serious encounters with investing come when they already have responsibilities—mortgages, children, retirement planning. They're starting at a point where they should already be conservative. So when they experience even moderate volatility, it feels catastrophic.",
      "But what if the optimal path is actually to expose yourself to extreme volatility when you can afford it emotionally and financially?",
      "Traditional education teaches investing principles on paper. But there's a world of difference between understanding volatility intellectually and experiencing it viscerally. You need to feel the emotions—the fear, the doubt, the temptation to sell at the bottom. You need to make mistakes when the stakes are still relatively low.",
      "I learned this the hard way during the 2018 bear market. I watched Bitcoin plummet from $20,000 to $3,000 without having taken any profit. It was excruciating. I nearly threw in the towel.",
      "I remember calling a friend who was also heavily invested. I was on the verge of tears. He told me to relax, take a walk, close my computer, and not read anything market-related for a week. 'Bitcoin will keep chugging along,' he said. He was right.",
      "These moments test your conviction. You have to constantly reunderwrite your thinking, asking yourself: 'Do the fundamental reasons I invested still hold true?' This constant reassessment builds intellectual rigor that textbooks can't teach.",
      "Our world is shaped by tail events far more than we like to admit. World War II, the '09 crash, COVID—these aren't footnotes in history; they're chapters. How you respond during these extraordinary moments often determines your long-term outcomes.",
      "Crypto markets essentially speed-run market cycles. What might take the stock market a decade to experience, crypto can go through in a year. That concentrated experience builds a kind of emotional resilience that's hard to acquire any other way.",
      "Does this mean everyone young should pile into volatile assets? No. The specific path doesn't matter as much as the principle: find ways to experience significant volatility and tail events early, when you can afford the tuition payments of emotional distress and occasional financial losses.",
      "Risk tolerance isn't static. It evolves with your life circumstances. The birth of a child can instantly transform your time horizon and goals. But if you've already built the muscle of handling volatility, you're better equipped to make that transition wisely rather than fearfully.",
      "I'm in that transition now. In some respects, I wish I could still take the kind of risk I did in 2016, but I realize that would be foolish with two young children depending on me. As many smart people have written, making wealth and keeping it are two very different skill sets. You concentrate to get rich and diversify to stay rich.",
      "Most investing advice optimizes for avoiding mistakes. But maybe the optimal long-term strategy is to make your mistakes early, when the absolute dollar value is lower, and the lessons are proportionally more valuable.",
      "As Taleb would say, you want to be antifragile—not just resistant to volatility and uncertainty, but actually strengthened by it. This antifragility comes from lived experience, not books.",
      "When I was 99% in crypto, I constantly evaluated the worst-case scenario: a day-zero hack where it all went to zero. I really tried to imagine what it would be like if those assets went to nothing. Would that be horrific? Yes. But I was earning a decent income and young enough that I could start again if I had to.",
      "Did it make sense to go 'all in'? I felt I had done the work. I had read absolutely everything I possibly could on Bitcoin and crypto and the birth of Ethereum and smart contracts. Reading Joel Monegro's Fat Protocol thesis on the day he wrote it was the epiphany I needed. My conviction wasn't blind faith—it was built on hundreds of hours of research.",
      "The market tested that conviction repeatedly. Beyond that 2018 crash from $20,000 to $3,000, I lived through the COVID flash crash of March 2020, watching Bitcoin plummet nearly 50% in a single day. Each cycle taught me something different about market psychology and my own risk tolerance.",
      "For years, people laughed when I talked about crypto. I became embarrassed to tell others what I was really into. But looking back, that social discomfort was actually useful—it meant I wasn't just following the crowd. The biggest returns often come from ideas that seem strange to most people at first.",
      "You have to play the game on the field, not the one you wish existed. Our economy has been financialized in virtually every possible aspect. With constant debasement and the Cantillon effect—where money creation benefits those closest to the printing press—you need hard assets just to stay in place.",
      "This reality wasn't obvious to me at first. But as I studied monetary history and watched central bank balance sheets explode post-2008, it became clear why Bitcoin's fixed supply was more than just a technical feature—it was a profound innovation in a world where everything else could be diluted at will.",
      "The financial world doesn't reward the traditionally prudent as much as those with the courage to act when there's 'blood in the streets.' During these tail events—these moments of maximum fear—most people don't just freeze; they panic and sell, which is usually catastrophic to returns. These are precisely the moments that determine long-term outcomes.",
      "Turns out you have to get used to being the odd one out if you want asymmetric returns in life."
